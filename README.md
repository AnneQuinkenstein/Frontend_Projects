Please note that this project uses the free instance of [Render](https://render.com/) for Backend and Database. There might be delays due to inactivity-induced instance spin-down. Keep this in mind when accessing the deployed application. It's recommended to [trigger](https://backend-projects-8pai.onrender.com)  the Backend before taking a look at the website the first time.
